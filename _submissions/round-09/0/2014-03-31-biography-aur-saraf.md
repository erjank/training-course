I plan to make code literacy a basic skill as common as literacy is today.

I come from programming but lately I&#8217;ve been running a small startup, and before that I founded and managed a series of internal programming courses in a large organization.

I&#8217;m active in the [Israeli branch][2] of [OpenTechSchool][3].

Last year, for fun, I volunteered to teach tenth graders 8086 assembly language.
