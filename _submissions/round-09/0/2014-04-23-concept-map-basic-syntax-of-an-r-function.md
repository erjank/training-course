When teaching novice users R, I find that they get hung up with the basic syntax(i.e. causes the most frustration and most interested in learning). Seems that providing a basic understanding of R syntax up front could defuse some of the issues later on. Perhaps more importantly, it will allow them to begin to decipher the R help pages  a bit sooner.

Thanks to both Jonathan and Aur I think I have a much improved v2 of the R function syntax concept map. Although the quality of the image is much worse.  Sorry!
