This is supposed to show how you can set up git for an existing project. I wanted to showÂ  that there is a linear &#8216;normal&#8217; workflow without git, and that using git allows you to make interventions in that workflow.

One thing the concept map shows me is that the concepts are very closely assigned to the commands, at least for me.
