Hi all, here&#8217;s a go at a concept map for &#8220;functions&#8221;. My motivation was something I read a few times in the Julia documentation, &#8220;write functions, not scripts!&#8221;. The authors clearly had the impression that scientists and researchers don&#8217;t rate function decomposition very highly!

I was surprised at how much easier it was to explain *why* functions were useful, rather than simply *what* they were.

**EDIT:** updated after feedback from Mark Wilber.

Now we&#8217;re really starting to look like spaghetti. Even though it&#8217;s messy, I think it&#8217;s important to inter-relate concepts. There could probably be many more arrows drawn across the page.
