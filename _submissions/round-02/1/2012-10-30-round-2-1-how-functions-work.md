I will deal with on the concept of functions explaining how they work (with examples in Python).

Functions can be compared to elements of a workflow. Scientists often have to re-apply the same procedures and repeat certain tasks. They can easily do it by writing and using functions. Organising source code into functions saves time, makes programs less error-prone and can help to reproduce the results, if needed. Functions are also one big step towards writing libraries which can be very powerful tools.

Here is an example of using functions: https://github.com/apawlik/SCW-Teaching-R2/blob/master/Teaching-R2/HowFunctionsWork.py

In response to Greg&#8217;s comment about having too many concepts in the concept map, I updated the cmap. Still quite a few things in it but a bit better (at least that &#8220;stack&#8221; is not there).
