I spent about an hour Wednesday evening thinking and messing about with Cmap (which I picked up from the Round 1 posts, and I highly recommend it:  http://cmap.ihmc.us/).  For a concept I started with &#8220;What&#8217;s a file?&#8221;.  It is **way** too easy to go past 6 nodes on a cmap on some subject you know a lot about!  Reined myself in, trimmed it down to 6 nodes.

Then tried to think of an &#8220;example to illustrate the concept&#8221;.  Uh&#8230; okay.  &#8216;ls': Here&#8217;s a filename.  Here&#8217;s its extension.  &#8216;pwd': here&#8217;s it&#8217;s location.  &#8216;ls -l': here&#8217;s how big it is.

Half a dozen worked examples to reduce cognitive load?  What do you get students to *do* to cement the concept of a file and a mere five related concepts?  That they could use scaffolded examples to help them with?  I think this target is too small and simple for this machinery.  Is it?  Am I fooling myself?  Did I pick the wrong related concepts?  Did I pick a poor concept to try this on?  Let&#8217;s try another one.  Let me see&#8230; How about types?  Python types: int, float, and str.

Well, that&#8217;s three concepts for the cmap right away. I struggled for a while to come up with three and *only* three related concepts to fill out the map, then threw away &#8216;str&#8217; and turned it into a cmap for &#8216;numeric types&#8217;.

Thursday afternoon, I return to cook up an example and some worked examples.  Let me see, how do you determine the range and size-in-bytes of a Python float or int?  <rummage, rummage>  Well, we could exponentiate big numbers until we get an overflow error.  Oh yeah, and we might have to explain what the &#8216;L&#8217; is about at the end of a Python long int.  Talk about irrelevant distractions&#8230;

But wait a sec &#8212; Supposing I&#8217;d done that, what is there left for the student to try?  Some other random numbers to narrow down where they get overflow?  Or underflow?  Bah!  This doesn&#8217;t feel right.

Referring to HLW pp.105-106, I read about worked examples being used to &#8220;manage cognitive load as [students] learn to perform complex tasks.&#8221;  What I feel is lacking here is a task &#8212; or at least a complex one.  A concept is not a task.  &#8220;Numerical types&#8221; is not a &#8220;how&#8221;, it&#8217;s a &#8220;what&#8221;.

Thursday evening.  Back to http://software-carpentry.org/2012/10/key-points/ once again, this time hunting for something more like a task &#8212; a complex one, that is.  (Read that like Foghorn Leghorn, if you remember who he was.)

Let&#8217;s have a go at shell scripts, shamelessly mining Greg&#8217;s notes for the concept map.

Now a simple, yet motivated, example:

<pre># ----- getenergy -----
# Pick some particularly interesting lines
# out of a molecular energy calculation.
# Run this with 'bash getenergy filename'
grep 'SCF Done:' $1
grep -A 13 'Input orientation' $1
# 'grep -A 13' will give the line that
#  matches AND the 13 following lines</pre>

Use &#8216;ethanol.out&#8217; as test input for this (to be supplied).

EXERCISES

(1) Modify &#8216;getenergy&#8217; above so it will print an arbitrary number of lines after &#8216;Input orientation&#8217; instead of always thirteen. For example, if you run it like this: `bash getenergy ethanol.out 6`, it will print six lines.  Or seven with `bash getenergy ethanol.out 7`.

(2) Take a copy of the following unfinished script and fill in the blank so that it will pick the &#8216;SCF Done&#8217; line out of TWO files you name:

<pre># Run this with 'bash getenergies file1 file2'
for $somefile in ___  ___
do
    grep 'SCF Done:' $somefile
done</pre>

(3) Take the script from the previous exercise and modify it so it will take an arbitrarily large number of files.  (Did you remember to modify the comment, too?)

Time spent:  About 4 hours.
