Think of **=**, which is the assignment operator, as filling out of a lanyard or name tag or label that someone is going to wear around their head/neck. The variable name is to the left of the **=**, and the person it labels is to the right. From then on, you can refer to whoever gets the nametag by the label on it. Suppose there&#8217;s already someone named Finn in our code. We make make Finn a new nametag:

<pre>coolest_hero = Finn</pre>

Turns out that anyone can wear more than one label and labels exist within a context (some scope). If the idea of having multiple names seems odd, consider Finn at a conference: he might be referred to by his name as just &#8220;Finn&#8221;,  now also as &#8220;coolest_hero&#8221; or as &#8220;Attendee #114&#8243; for the purposes of a prize drawing, or also as &#8220;moderator of the first panel&#8221;.

<pre>attendee_114 = Finn
moderator_panel_1 = Finn</pre>

These last two make sense as labels for the duration of the conference, and indeed, during \*his\* panel, Finn might simple be referred to simply as &#8220;moderator&#8221;.

<pre>while panel_1_in_session:
    moderator = Finn
    ...</pre>

But someone else will have that label during the other panels.

<pre>while panel_2_in_session:
    moderator = Jake
    ...</pre>

One caveat about the limitations of this analogy is that within a context, all labels are unique, so that when Finn&#8217;s hero Billy arrives at the conference, we transfer the &#8220;coolest hero&#8221; tag to Billy, and anyone referring to &#8220;coolest hero&#8221; from then on would be referring to Billy.

<pre>coolest_hero = Billy</pre>

We can assign a new label to someone referred by another. For example, let&#8217;s make another label for referring to Billy:

<pre>last_arrival = coolest_hero</pre>

We can also do the above two assignments in one line, because a given expression can get assigned to multiple variable at the same time.

<pre>last_arrival = coolest_hero = Billy</pre>

In general, any expression can go on the right hand side of an assignment. Suppose that Finn and Jake know how to to combine into a dynamic duo, when you add them together:

<pre>dynamic_duo = Finn + Jake</pre>

Or getting back to something simpler, we can label things, as well as people &#8211; let&#8217;s label a number.

<pre>lucky_number = 3 + 4</pre>

The right hand side gets evaluated first, so first the expression 3+&#8221; gets evaluated to 7, and then 7 gets assigned to &#8220;luck_number&#8221;.

Because the right hand side gets evaluated first, you sometimes see a variable name on both sides.

<pre>lucky_number = 6 * lucky_number</pre>

So on the right hand side, &#8220;lucky\_number&#8221; was a label for 7, but after the expression 6*7 evaluated to 42, 42 was assigned back to the variable &#8220;lucky\_number&#8221;. Recall that we can only have one &#8220;lucky\_number&#8221; within a scope, just like we could only have one &#8220;coolest\_hero&#8221;.
