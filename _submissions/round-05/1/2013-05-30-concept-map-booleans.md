This concept map explain what the booleans are, how they are used, and how they operate (boolean algebra).  I&#8217;ve marked in red two bits, one it&#8217;s the danger on previous knowledge regarding a programming language (top right), as not all follow the same convention to what it&#8217;s true or false, and the other warning (top left) it&#8217;s to the term *word* going out from bit.  This *word* refers to the [natural unit of data][1], so the note to take from there &#8211; for more advance users- is that the booleans are not really a single bit.<figure id="attachment_2950" style="width: 707px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
