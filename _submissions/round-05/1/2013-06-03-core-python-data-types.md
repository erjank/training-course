This is my attempt at trying to give a high-level organization to the core built-in Python data types and their uses.  I avoided including other &#8216;types&#8217; like object, type, etc. to simplify the map as well as gear it towards beginners.  I think including things like the base &#8216;object&#8217; and other more infrastructure data types would have made the overall concept harder to grasp.

I&#8217;d like to think this is how I would begin to explain the &#8216;batteries included&#8217; philosophy of Python to **very** beginning Python developers.  So, I chose to organize it in a way that could provide students with a quick way to look up the proper data type assuming they already know the problem they want to solve like &#8216;simple math&#8217; or &#8216;store a list of unordered information.&#8217;
