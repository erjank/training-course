Organizing the miriad of files with data, source code, and results that make up a scientific project can be a challenge for many scientists. Good organization and clear documentation are key in order to guarantee the reproducibility of scientific results. In my lesson, I&#8217;m presenting a few strategies to keep scientific projects documented and well-organized in a computer, using simple tools that require no computational background.

&nbsp;

Assessment questions:

1) Explain briefly the differences between data, src, and results folders.

2) The computer filesystem:

&#8211; can represent well any relationship between files

&#8211; can represent well only hierarchical structures

&#8211; can be used to our advantage in organizing our projects

&nbsp;

3) How project documentation should be?

&#8211; for your eyes only

&#8211; such as other scientist or myself can reproduce my results

&#8211; as detailed as possible
