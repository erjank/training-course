I was thinking of doing a short (< 3 mins) explanation of how to rescue your code(not always possible) when you do &#8220;`git reset --hard`&#8221; with mistake.  
[<img src="/software-carpentry-training-website/uploads/2013/06/header.jpg" alt="header" width="600" height="100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3435" />][1]  
Git users are told to use &#8220;`git reset --hard`&#8221; carefully, it could erase all your endeavor in seconds. Because people use it less than other commands,  
it is a dangerous and error prone command. In some circumstances, you are luck to mend your mistake, I&#8217;ll show you how to do that.

What do you think?
