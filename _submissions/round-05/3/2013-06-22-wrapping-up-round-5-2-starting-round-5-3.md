**2013-06-20**  
**Meeting of the Software Carpentry Instructors Study Group**  
Round 5.2/5.3

Every conference call ever: <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/09/conference-calls/>

**Agenda**

*   Did people understand your questions correctly?
*   Did they separate novice/competent/expert accurately?
*   Is it even possible to come up with a succinct question that separates competent from expert?
*   How long did it take to come up with good questions? (Or based on feedback, how long *would* it take?)

**Entries**

*   Overall: <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/category/proficiency/round-5-2/>
*   Shell assessment (Preston): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/12/shell-assessment/> (in the end I feel better about my novice question &#8211; being able to identify the main basic use of a common tool or concept &#8211; I found coming up with a master question very tricky, as to be advanced it had to be detailed, but with then at the same time becomes very narrow &#8211; and so subject to being hit-or-miss with regard to an expert&#8217;s specific mosaic &#8211; this took me maybe 15-20 minutes)
*   Python data structures (Philipp): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/12/basic-python-data-structures-assessment/> (My intermediate question was probably too easy &#8211; I tried to check whether people knew about the behaviour (and ideally big O-attributes) of these data structures, especially when it comes to large amounts of data)
*   List comprehension (Karmel): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/12/multiple-choice-assessment-list-comprehension/>
*   Pipe and redirect (Yuxi): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/13/multiple-choice-assessment-piperedirect-comprehension/> about the expert question, my point is, if you are a master, you should have at least 50% of right answers. And in fact, I&#8217;m not expert about this, so, maybe some questions are not suitable.
*   File permissions (David): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/14/multiple-choice-assessment-file-permissions/>
*   Java (Jordan): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/14/java-proficiency-questions/> All 4 answers were correct. The novice question didn&#8217;t take long to come up with, the expert question was another story. I found it difficult to come up with a succient question for intermediate/expert separation.
*   Regular expressions (Martin): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/15/py-regex/>
*   (took quite some time to design the question, particularly the expert vs competent- question)
*   Regular expressions (Julia): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/16/regular-expressions/> (I&#8217;m not satisfied with the novice question &#8212; people got it wrong despite being competent. I came up with the question before the topic.)
*   MPI (Neal): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/17/multiple-choice-assessment-basic-mpi-routines/> (I don&#8217;t know MPI &#8211; but I was tempted to look up the API documentation when reading these questions !)â€”only one answer which (correctly) surmised the answer to the novice/competent question, but no tries or discussion on the expert/competent question. MPI&#8217;s probably a little esoteric for most folks. I found it challenging to frame a multiple choice question which distinguished expertise from competency, particularly as context starts to matter a lot more there. So the question style isn&#8217;t generally adequate for that distinction, I think.
*   Python &#8211; yes, all of it (Luke): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/17/python-noviceintermediateexpert-assessment/> (Novice question took only a few minutes, but expert question took lots of on and off thinking. I think the questions seemed to do a decent job at separating the groups. The most difficult part was coming up with plausible chioces for the expert question. I think questions to determine experts are more suited for discussion, short answer, etc.)
*   SQL &#8211; yes, all of it (David): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/18/sql-noviceintermediateexpert-assessment/> Found that designing the expert question was much more subtle than I had expected
*   Bears (Kirsten): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/18/beginner-and-intermediate-questions-about-bears/> (and may I say, I didn&#8217;t expect that one)
*   Genetics (Billy): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/18/assessing-proficiency-at-classical-genetics/> I think the questions were understood. Question 1 separated novices from the unwashed masses, and question 2 seemed difficult enough, but I&#8217;m not sure if it was &#8220;competent&#8221; or &#8220;expert&#8221; level. It was difficult to write a succinct expert question, which was why I ended up writing a glorified vocabulary question.
*   Pass by ref/value (Ted): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/18/passing-by-reference-and-by-value-in-python/> Yes, respondents understood. I think my questions separated levels of knowledge, but not necessarily &#8220;mastery&#8221; as we defined it last week. I think this first pair of questions, with improved distractors, would have taken a half hour.
*   Functions vs. methods (Jessica): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/19/python-functions-vs-methods/> I think people understood the first question, the second question maybe wasn&#8217;t clear enough. My first question was actually meant to separate two levels of intermediate &#8212; there were two correct answers and I think if you get one but not the other, you&#8217;re competent, and if you get both, you&#8217;re at a higher level of competency (but not necessarily at expert, which the second question was meant to address more). Coming up with the questions took me a good portion of yesterday, and it was maybe even a bit easier because I based the ideas I was testing off of a blog post I&#8217;d written in the past.
*   SQL grouping (Shoaib): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/20/multiple-choice-sql-group-by-again/> (coming up with the questions took longer than I thought &#8211; as I had to think of realistic choices or mis-understandings)
*   Basic bash (Katie): <http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/20/3264/> I was late in getting the question up, so no one answered, but it was a good exercise to think about the questions. (Anybody want to answer now? :] ) It was difficult to come up with them. I think having specific learning goals would make it easier. I wanted to make expert questions that involved creating something, but that might make a lot of time to answer.
*   Python operators (Itamar) -<http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/06/17/python-operators-quiz/> people did understand my question, and I&#8217;m pretty sure it separated decently, with the assumption at least that expertise is fairly rare. I definitely would have preferred a follow up &#8220;and \*why\* did you choose that answer&#8221; for people who got expert answer correctly, to verify it&#8217;s not just someone who is confused.
*   Python difference between module & package (Promita)
*   I thought it was difficult to only rely on a few questions to separate the 3 groups

**Thoughts**

<http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Design-Expanded-2nd-Edition/dp/0131950843/>:

*   questions, then lessons
*   the first thing to do is to decide on assessment
*   then backtrack to identify key practice skills for exam preparation
*   then identify concepts and lessons for preparatory tasks.
*   Then construct coherent lessons on this basis (feels backwards).

Work backwards: what I want to assess, what they need to know/do to pass that assessment
