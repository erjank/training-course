I designed my concept map by trying to answer the following two questions:  
1) What would I want to teach someone new to Python before introducing them to an &#8220;if&#8221; statement?  
2) Once s/he understands an &#8220;if&#8221; statement, what would I need to cover such that s/he could write a script with complicated flow control?  
Thus, I have bolded the main stepping stones that I followed. Please let me know how I can improve it. Thanks!
