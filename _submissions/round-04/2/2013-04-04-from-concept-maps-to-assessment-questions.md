**Meeting of the Software Carpentry Instructors Study Group**  
2013-04-03  
Round 4.1/4.2

**Agenda**

*   What did you learn about your chosen concept from doing a concept map?
*   What would you do differently having seen other people&#8217;s concept maps?
*   Too big, too small, too high-level, too low-level, too mixed-level, &#8230;?
*   [this][1] is too large, [this][2] is too small
*   See also Steve Eddins on [testing image processing][3] (to motivate Will Trimble&#8217;s concept map on [floating point representation][4])
*   Would you use this: 
    *   to prepare for teaching
    *   in class?
*   How would you tell if someone had understood the concepts?
*   How would you distinguish these three levels of understanding: 
    *   Novice
    *   Intermediate (can apply rules, doesn&#8217;t know when to break them)

* * *

Greg: embedding images in a concept map for image processing

Few used questions/question marks in their concept maps

*   Exceptions: Rich FitzJohn, Patrick March
*   [Dunning-Kruger effect][5]: the less people know, the less accurate their estimation of their own knowledge
*   Project planning: let the bubbles explode, then ask &#8220;Which subset of about half a dozen bubbles am I am going to tackle?&#8221; 
    *   (~ 7 bits of infromation)
*   Using concept maps in teaching 
    *   test your own understanding of concept ideas for lesson development
    *   refresh ideas before class
    *   to assess students understanding of concept
    *   provide students with a concept map as a form of &#8220;teaching to the test&#8221;
*   What is skill level? 
    *   Novice: 
        *   doesn&#8217;t know what they don&#8217;t know (incompetant and ignorant)
        *   the less competant you are, the less accurate your estimation of your own competence
    *   Competent Practicioner: 
        *   can use it proficiently
        *   asks questions about special/edge cases
    *   Expert: 
        *   knows when to break the rules, has more dense concept map in their head
        *   has more densly connected map, fewer jumps between concepts. This has pros and cons
        *   can handle special cases
        *   expert knows why
        *   experts estimation of how hard this is is very reliable, (compared ot novice who is just guessing)
*   How to determine if someone is an novice or expert? 
    *   No universal scale of ability (and self-assessment unreliable, as above)
*   How do you tell if someone simply didn&#8217;t get it? 
    *   carefully chosen test question?
    *   can they transfer skill to another context, or is skill context dependent?
*   The longer the field has had big data, the more likely you are to find skills *but* variance within groups is much larger than differences between means

**For April 17 meeting:**

*   Read Chapter 4 of <cite>How Learning Works</cite> (&#8220;How Do Students Develop Mastery?&#8221;)
*   Choose a topic that someone else did a concept map for (either in [Round 4.1][6] or the [previous round][7])
*   By Wednesday April 10, write a blog post (in [Round 4.2][8]) with: 
    *   Two questions that distinguish novice from competent practioner (correctness of answers should be objective)
    *   Two questions that distinguish competent practioner from expert (correctness of answers may be subjective, i.e., more than one way to do it)
*   By Tuesday April 16, comment on at least two other people&#8217;s posts
*   We&#8217;ll meet at the same times on April 17
*   Please make sure you have a copy of <cite>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</cite> by April 17
*   If you are not already on the Software Carpentry &#8216;discuss&#8217; list, please join
