I&#8217;ve been (slowly) learning Git for the past few months, and like most things that are new, you pick up what you need to survive, and little else. In this concept map, I&#8217;ve sketched out &#8220;you&#8221; on the right, and one other teammate who might be working with you on a project (but there could be more). The intended audience is for the beginner or novice programmer who may benefit from distributed version control, and the implied etiquette and discipline it requires to be useful.Â On a more fundamental level, I think version control should be a model taught across multi-disciplinary teams of scientists and engineers, researchers. I want this concept map to evolve into a cheatsheet of sorts, included with all of the commands that one might have to remember. Using GitHub may vary quite a lot depending on the project, and depending on your role within projects, and it would be nice to derive one that is both comprehensive and simple.
