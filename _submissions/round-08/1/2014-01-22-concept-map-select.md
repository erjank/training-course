While all the hipsters are out muddling with NoSQL data, you can use the tried and true method of extracting data from your good old relational database with the handy SELECT statement! Assumes learners know what a database is (with a brief refresher on tables/rows). Should be teachable in 5min. I used my highlighters for the first time!

Feedback welcome. Be honest, I can take it, I swear. As I was drawing this, I realized I was unsure whether the WHERE clause should filter back onto the SELECT or the Result set. I settled on Result set since that&#8217;s what happens in my brain.<figure id="attachment_5584" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone">
