This was interesting: I thought that a concept map of variable scope would be dead simple. I was wrong: there are a lot of concepts hidden in here that I take for granted, but that someone new to programming would struggle with. Not only that: a lot of the concepts are not directly accessible to the learner in the form of a concrete expression. e.g. You can clearly show a function definition, but hoisting requires some knowledge about the way the interpreter works.

I also found that my first attempt was actually more of a flow diagram <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />
