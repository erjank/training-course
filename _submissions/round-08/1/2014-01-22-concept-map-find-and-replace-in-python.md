An introduction to text processing tools for intermediate-level learners of Python. The first language I ever learned was AWK, and it&#8217;s also how I got into Python. I use string methods and regex all the time, especially for data file formatting etc, but have recently discovered the joy of Pandas so maybe I&#8217;ll be doing less of this stuff now.

This was my 3rd attempt, after running out of space twice on paper. There&#8217;s a possible blind-leading-the-blind issue here as I&#8217;ve hardly internalized this myself, but I think I could introduce people to the subject. I&#8217;m not thrilled with how it turned out â€” it&#8217;s less &#8216;mappy&#8217; than I thought it was going to be. As in all things, more white space would probably help. Well, green space.
