Forgive my sometimes tiny and unreadable handwriting.Â  The map seemed lonesome on its own, so I added some ideas at the top for questions that students might already have that would lead into a discussion of system calls.

The target audience would have at least some programming knowledge (arrays, structs) and some amount of knowledge of basic computer architecture (instructions,registers, memory, cpu).
