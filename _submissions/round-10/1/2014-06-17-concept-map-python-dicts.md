I decided against a topic other participants wouldn&#8217;t be familiar with &#8211; I decided it&#8217;s too hard to judge whether a map is any good if the topic is new to you.

I actually had an interesting experience as I showed the map to my partner; the topic he was familiar with he appreciated, but the unfamiliar one I think he just saw as a confronting mass of information. If the information is really new rather than a review, the non-linearity of the map means a novice doesn&#8217;t even know where to start in traversing the information, and (I think) it&#8217;s actually more confronting than a list.

So this is a pretty simple topic, python dicts!
