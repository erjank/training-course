In teaching Mathematics to student teachers of Mathematics, I include a section on representing numbers in different bases. This serves to force them to reflect on what is meant by the usual positional value system we use. Choosing a base other than 10, means that they really have to think about the grouping that happens when performing operations like addition and subtraction as well as the role of zero as a place holder. Also the meaning of 10 in a base other than ten usually causes a great deal of discussion. This is my basic first attempt at a concept map for this area. I need to extend it to include the role of zero, the relationship of one columns values to another, converting between various bases and more.
