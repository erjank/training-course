  <strong>Multiple Choice Questions</strong>
</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Which of these commands adds another value to the PATH variable?
</p>

1.  PATH=/home/user/bin
2.  echo $PATH=/home/user/bin
3.  $PATH=/home/user/bin
4.  PATH=$PATH:/home/user/bin

Which of these commands lists the value(s) assigned to the PATH variable?

1.  <span style="line-height: 16px;">set</span>
2.  ls $PATH
3.  echo $PATH
4.  $PATH

Sorry for being a bit late on this guys, life decided to be a bit unreasonable this weekend. I hope the diagram covers the basic concept of environment variables. I would have gone further to explain PATH, but I thought that would make the diagram too big.
