It got a bit complicated &#8211; click on the image to see the whole thing.

I created this diagram using RDF, which I think is a very natural way to express concept maps. (Shameless plug: I created an interactive environment, &#8220;Beaver&#8221;, which interprets RDF triples and can spit out diagrams like this: https://github.com/bendmorris/beaver)

I&#8217;m a visual learner, and after spelling out how concepts are related, being able to generate and look at a graphic that shows how all these ideas are interconnected really helps me structure my thoughts and gives an idea of where teaching should start and how it should flow. I think this would be a very helpful way to organize my thoughts prior to teaching.
