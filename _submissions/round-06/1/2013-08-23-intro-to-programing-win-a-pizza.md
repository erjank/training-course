This map is the basis for program to evaluate a game that the faculty member, who is teaching a Intro Programing course, new to the department for undergraduates. He runs an active classroom and has the students participate. Here, he writes the code in class as an example of how one may go about creating code. He then runs the code to determine a winner. He collects via a web portal the students guess of what would be 2/3 of the average of all the submissions. Student closest, wins a pizza.
