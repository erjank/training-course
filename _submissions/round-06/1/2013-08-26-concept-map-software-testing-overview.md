Hopefully this is legible (I think you&#8217;ll need to click on the image to enlarge it so you can read it). I envision drawing this as the lecture goes so the students see the interconnection as the lecture progresses. It&#8217;s a little overwhelming at the outset &#8211; but I wanted to illustrate the different ways I think of software testing and how those ideas relate to one another. It looks like a lot of material, but I wouldn&#8217;t go into detail about the testing types. This is an overview to introduce testing types before hands on examples of each type.
