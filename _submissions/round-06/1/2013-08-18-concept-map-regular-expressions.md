Regular expressions are extremely useful for manipulating and parsing text, which is something I find I need to do quite often when working with large data files in biology. This got a little out of hand as I was putting it together, but hopefully it is still simple enough to be useful.Â [

After feedback that this was way too much information, I simplified it some:

I still agree that this was probably an ambitious topic for 10 minutes, I&#8217;ve thought of about a dozen more compact topics since!
