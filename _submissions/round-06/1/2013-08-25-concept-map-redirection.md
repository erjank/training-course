Sorry for the late submission of this assignment. I decided to go for teaching redirection rather than pipes because I felt that to introduce pipes would require the introduction of streams and redirection. To teach all this, effectively, in under 10min would be too much. I went with this sort of topic as I think the knowledge of streams and use of pipes is such an under-utilised and underestimated skill.

I&#8217;ve kept the concept map free from clutter as I wanted to have this image in the forefront of the student&#8217;s mind at the end of the class. I think it&#8217;s a nice summary of the three streams and the characters used for redirection. I also thought about putting in things like 2>&1 for redirecting STDERR and STDOUT at the same time but decided against it for a beginner class and the same can be achieved with &#8220;2> out.stderr > out.stdout&#8221;.
