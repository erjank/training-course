Although many new people prefer to open documents in something more like textwrangler, I think it&#8217;s important to know how to do at least quick edits in a command line editor, especially if you do your work on remote machines. This would be a 10 minute absolute basics of VI, just enough that when they open a document they understand that there are modes, how to switch between them, and how to do a simple edit.
