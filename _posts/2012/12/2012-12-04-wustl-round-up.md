Here is a summary for the November 2012 workshop at Washington University at St. Loius.  There were three instructors; Justin Ely, Jessica Kerr, and Sarah Supp.  We covered Python (no shell) on the first day, and Git and SQL/Databases on the second day.  I won&#8217;t go into detail on each section &#8211; we all know the basics of what these would entail &#8211; but will instead share anything that went well or poorly.

We had about 20 people attend the workshop.  They were a good distribution of grad-students, post-docs, and professors primarily from the biology department.  While a few students were well versed in at least 1 language, and very comfortable, most of the students had little to no programming experience.

In my opinion, the biggest asset for this tutorial was having someone in the same field as the attendees.  Sarah was able to tailor the exercises and examples towards the biological perspective.  I felt like the familiarity with the data and the end goal of each section allowed them to focus more on the new tool they were learning without being distracted by: &#8220;what is the data again&#8230;.and what am I trying to do with it?&#8221;.

The biggest thing we could have done better would have been to provide a more structured lesson plan.  We essentially taught three independent lessons (python,Git,SQL), but we didn&#8217;t provide much to bridge the three.  In hindsight we would start with a concept map of what we wanted to teach (which students really seemed to like when we brought it in later), and bring each lesson back to the map afterwards.  The concept map is also something we provided to the students afterwards, hopefully they can look to it in the future.

Additional quick notes: The iPython notebook can be a little confusing when you haven&#8217;t introduced the shell at all.  When people don&#8217;t know <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where</span> they are, they have a hard time interfacing with txt files and the like.  While I like the notebook as a teaching tool, I do find that the extra level of abstraction can be confusing&#8230;at least from this one trial.  Also, make sure security knows you are supposed to be there.  Apparently universities have silent alarms in their computer labs&#8230;.

We, of course, did the 1 good and 1 bad comment at the end.  You can see the summary below, hopefully you will find it useful in the future.
