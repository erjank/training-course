I&#8217;ve just added a link to a white paper by Sir John Daniel from 2012 titled &#8220;[Making Sense of MOOCs][1]&#8220;. A former vice-chancellor of the [Open University][2], he knows as much about over-the-web education as anyone alive; his thoughts on the current furore around massive online courses are pointed and well-informed.
