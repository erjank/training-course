A Concept map for teaching the basics of \`data.tables\` to a novice in R. What I would hope to cover in 5-10 minutes:

1.  What a \`data.table\` looks like in an interactive session.
2.  How to access a column.
3.  How to extract rows.

The rest of the bubbles are related concepts not necessarily on the critical path for the lesson, but discussion may diverge depending on the learner&#8217;s prior knowledge (especially if they&#8217;ve had some exposure to R, and know what a \`data.frame\` is).
