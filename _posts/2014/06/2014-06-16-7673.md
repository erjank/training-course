I put this together fairly quickly as I had been thinking about the stuff for a while. I normally would have used a bigger sheet of paper (A3 is nice as you can fold it in half and put it in a regular  A4 ring binder &#8211; just punch the holes before you make the map so you don&#8217;t destroy any text)  but I don&#8217;t have a large bed scanner.

I suspect that the author of a concept map gets more out of creating the map than a reader/viewer gets out of reading the map &#8211; but perhaps a user will see an unexpected approach and so can get something from a map.

When I want to write something I normally generate a concept map without any regard to how I will order the components. I only start to think about an item sequence once I have exhausted myself on a topic. This is a key virtue of a concept map &#8211; it is not intrinsically sequential &#8211; it allows you to reduce cognitive load by separating concerns: collect the  ideas first only then worry about marshaling them into a story. Generally, I don&#8217;t make another outline &#8211; rather I will go through labeling bubbles with a number to indicate the order to tackle things. For something big I may tick off items as I deal with them.

Concept maps also make it relatively easy to add stuff &#8211; If I run out of space I just glue or staple on more paper to the side or I will cut up a map and glue the parts down on a larger sheet of paper. I typically treat concept maps as a scaffold for thinking rather than a end point in themselves so I don&#8217;t really worry if they are ugly. If I really want something neat I will redraw the map &#8211; a process that besides generating a nice copy also helps consolidate the ideas the map captures.

When I have a lot of ideas and I don&#8217;t entirely know how they fit together I will write the items on post it notes and stick them down on a large sheet of paper and draw arrows between them with pencil. If I don&#8217;t like an linkage I either erase the arrow or if things go really wrong I just start with a new sheet of paper. I will photocopy the arrangement to make things permanent &#8211; just remember to use post its in a colour that shows up when you photocopy it against a white back ground ( yellow is a bad colour for this)

If you want to use colour as a mnemonic marker you can either just use coloured pens or you can use the sort of ball point pen that allows use to choose from 4 different colours &#8211; this type of pen makes it very easy and quick to highlight or mark some text.

I have occasionally tried software packages for mind maps or concept maps but they have always been a disappointment as they are far to slow for the way I work &#8211; perhaps if I used a digital drawing tablet I could sketch things up quickly and then convert it from a bitmap into some sort of connected graph  but I don&#8217;t think the return would justify the effort.
