Using ssh with a private key is often confusing and it can be tricky to explain if the person isn&#8217;t already familiar with using a command line/shell or the basic concepts of public/private key cryptography.

I&#8217;m assuming that students have already been introduced to the following:

*   ssh with a password
*   shell and the command line

The following concept maps ties together those two concepts with the basics of public key cryptography necessary to understand how to ssh with a private key from a client machine to a server machine.

ssh with a private key is generally more secure than using a password and with some minimal configuration is much easier to use especially if you have to log into multiple other machines.

The map doesn&#8217;t address:

*   why to use private keys instead of passwords
*   how to configure your account on the server to support using an ssh key to login
