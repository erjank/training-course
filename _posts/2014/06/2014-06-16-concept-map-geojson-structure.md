This is the third or fourth iteration of my map. I had some versions showing much more detail (all of the types, which ones have just coordinates and which have both coordinates and geometries, etc.) but I got the impression it was way too complicated/cluttered for a quick demo. Hard to avoid the temptation to write in definitions! Thanks in advance for your feedback. <img src="http://localhost:8080/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
