I believe basic data visualization is one of the first ways new programmers can interact with their data meaningfully, so this covers why you might want to plot something, how to get some numbers in the right form to be used by a plotting function, and then applying the plotting function. Along the way, alternatives are mentioned but in 5-10 mins there would probably not be time for them to try it out themselves (like reading in your own data from another source, or plotting disconnected markers).

I&#8217;m not sure if the focus is correct for this concept map exercise &#8211; it&#8217;s more about the steps I would plan to go through to introduce the ideas rather than a concept of the programming function itself.
