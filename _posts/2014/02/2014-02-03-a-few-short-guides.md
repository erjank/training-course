Via UBC&#8217;s Warren Code and [the resource page at the Carl Wieman Science Education Initiative][1], here are a handful of two-pagers you may find useful:

*   [First Day of Class â€“ Recommendations for Instructors][2] ([cached][3])
*   [Basic instructor Habits to Keep Students Engaged][4] ([cached][5])
*   [Motivating Learning][6] ([cached][7])
*   [What Not To Do][8] ([cached][9])

And, from Vanderbilt University, a [short guide to writing multiple-choice questions][10].
