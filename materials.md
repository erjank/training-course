## Main Readings

*   Mark Guzdial explains [why programming is hard to teach][1] (PDF). He also writes a very good [blog][2] about teaching computing.
*   [*How Learning Works*][3]: evidence-based best practices in teaching from a group at Carnegie Mellon)
*   [*Building a Better Teacher*][4]: why so many efforts to improve teaching have failed, and why.

## Books

*   [*Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering*][5] (slightly dated, but still the best short, readable guide we have to evidence-based software engineering)
*   [*Unlocking the Clubhouse*][6] (a good evidence-based discussion of the gender imbalance in computing—turns out that many of the factors that discourage women from going into computing also discourage scientists from learning how to code)
*   [*How People Learn*][7] (also available [online][8], largely superseded by *How Learning Works*)
*   [*What the Best College Teachers Do*][9] (brief and entertaining, if a bit gushy)
*   [*Teaching What You Don&#8217;t Know*][10] (which describes many of us—also brief and entertaining)
*   [*Design for How People Learn*][11] (for those with an artistic bent)
*   [*Understanding by Design*][12] (three times slower than it needs to be, but a good description of a methodical way to design instructional materials)
*   *[Making Software][13]* (a much larger and more up-to-date alternative to the *Facts and Fallacies* book)
